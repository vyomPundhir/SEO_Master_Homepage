## About Me

**Hey, I'm Vyom Pundhir**

- I'm 22 and I live in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. I'm currently learning **Full Stack Web Development**.

---

## Project Description

- In this project, I have built a **SEO Master HomePage** from the scratch using core `HTML` & `CSS`

- This project heavily relies on `flex-box` and various `flex properties` like `align-items, justify-content, gap `and `flex-direction`. Along with this the also comprises of `positioning various elements using margin and padding properties` in `CSS` This project also comprises of `height, width, background, font-family, font-weight, font-size` properties of `CSS`.

- Note that I haven't made it **Responsive** to **Different Screen Sizes**, so it will work only on the laptop screen. If you are using Desktop, please zoom in or out, that might work.

## What I have Learnt in this Project

- Good understanding of `HTML` & `CSS`.

- `flex` property of `CSS`:

  - how the `flex` property can be used to **align the elements present in column as row and with the help of flex properties the elements can be placed at any position**.

  - how we can use the `float` property to make 2 `div` come together in a row without using `CSS Flexbox`


- `margin` and `padding` property of `CSS`:

  - how the `margin` and `padding` properties can be used to adjust the position of an element.

- **Properties** used to edit the look of Button and Fonts:

  - learnt about how the property `border, border-radius, color, font-weight, font-family, font-size` to edit buttons and fonts.

## Time Taken to Finish this Project

> I took around **2 hours** to complete this project. The only thing that has taken much time to be implemented is how to position the **Elements.** Though this project is the first project in HTML & CSS section of the course.
---

I'm definitely more confident now in creating a webpage similar to this one.
